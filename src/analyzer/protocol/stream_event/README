TCP application analyzer for handing raw stream data to script-land.

This analyzer can be added as an upgrade analyzer, registered via the
well-known ports mechanism, or even DPD. It allows script-layer access
to the stream data when no more specific analyzer is available.

This is similar to the tcp_contents event, but more flexible in that it
can be added to an existing connection, or disabled over the lifetime
of a connection.
