This directory holds scripts and associated data to support maintenance of
ZAM optimization:

find-special-script-funcs.sh
	A shell script that prints to stdout a sorted list of script-level
	functions that the event engine knows about. Invoke with the path
	to the top-level src/ directory.

	Use this to compare with Special-Script-Funcs.list to see
	whether there are any new such functions (or old ones that have
	been removed).  If so, update src/script_opt/FuncInfo.cc and then
	Special-Script-Funcs.list accordingly.

Special-Script-Funcs.list
	The known-to-the-event-engine scripts that were present last time
	ZAM maintenance included looking for any updates to these.

list-bifs.zeek
	A Zeek script that prints to stdout a sorted list of the BiFs
	available for the Zeek invocation.

	Use this to compare with BiFs.list to see whether there are any
	new BiFs (or old ones that have been removed). If so, update
	src/script_opt/FuncInfo.cc and then BiFs.list accordingly.

BiFs.list
	The BiFs that were present last time ZAM maintenance included
	looking for any updates to available BiFs.
